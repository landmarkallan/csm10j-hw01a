1. display header
2. display purpose
3. create file Scanner Object
4. read and store file data
5. close file
6. display menu choices and get user input~selection
7. handle menu ~ user selection~input, process user inputs
7A. function call for menu name checking, output results
7B. function call for menu price checking, output results

Took me ~2 hrs, by luck~chance, from numerous trial and
error, to discover I needed to put the 'throws exception'
on two functions (main and read_file_data), along with
where to place the 'Scanner File Object', obviously too.

As I learn more of Java, I can design much better code.
I'm learning a lot from all of my errors in my code.
